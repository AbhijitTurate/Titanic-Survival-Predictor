# Titanic-Survival-Predictor
It's just a basic titanic predictor which I learnt to make by looking at a couple of sources.

It predicts whether a given person survived the devastating accident or not.
Currently, it predicts it with an accuracy of 83%

I'm using the RandomForestClassifier Algorithm here which I directly imported from SciKit Learn module in Python.
